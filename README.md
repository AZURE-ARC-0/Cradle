The Cradle framework is a first attempt at General Computer Control (GCC). Cradle supports agents to ace any computer task by enabling strong reasoning abilities, self-improvment, and skill curation, in a standardized general environment with minimal requirements.

We are still working on cleaning up the code and it will be released shortly. We are also extending Cradle to more games and software. Feel free to reach out!
